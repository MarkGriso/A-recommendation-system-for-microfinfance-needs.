# A-recommendation-system-for-microfinfance-needs.
Code showing my master thesis project

This project set out to develop a content-based recommendation system. 
The dataset used was that released by the Mircoredito Kiva platform, one of the largest microcredit platforms in the world. 

 HOW TO USE:
 
The system can be used by importing the two files 'Functions_for_recommendationSystem_Gui' and 'Gui_content_based_recommendationSystem'. 
The file with which to use the final system is the second one. The dataset to be imported is Kiva_loans_20k. The file has been reduced to twenty thousand observations for convenience. The files imported periodically by Kiva can exceed half a million observations.
